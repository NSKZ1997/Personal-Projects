    "is discarded by Youtube's algorithm, although such a thing could be accomplished by botting some anonymous channel with no views,\n",
    "and hoping that no one else is watching it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The autoclicker aspect of the program is used to navigate to a random video. Unlike many websites, Youtube's screen and \n",
    "'skip advertisement' buttons are not a part of simple HTML code. As a result, one can't click them using a simple webdriver such\n",
